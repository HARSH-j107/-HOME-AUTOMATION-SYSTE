NAME : HARSH PARASHAR

INTERN ID : CT04DG1982

DOMAIN : INTERNET OF THINGS

DURATION : June 17th 2025 - July 17th 2025

MENTOR : NEELA SANTOSH

INSTRUCTIONS : DESIGN A SYSTEM TO CONTROL AN LED LIGHT USING A MICROCONTROLLER (E.G., ARDUINO) AND A MOBILE APP. DELIVERABLE : A WORKING PROTOTYPE WHERE THE LIGHT RESPONDS TO APP-BASED COMMANDS

This project extends the smart light control system to include **multiple appliances**, like a light and a fan.

- **Microcontroller:** ESP8266  
- **App:** Blynk (Virtual Pins: V1 for Light, V2 for Fan)  
- **Components:** 2 relays or simulated using LEDs  
- **Features:**
  - Control multiple devices remotely
  - Modular design for future expansion
